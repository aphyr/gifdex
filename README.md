# Gifdex

A local gif indexing program. You've got a directory full of gifs! This is a
little web app that helps you browse and tag them. It stores the tags in a
local edn file. It's a giant hack and is presented completely as-is.

## Usage

You'll need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and a JVM.

`lein run wherever/gifs/are` will launch a web server on port 6549 by default.
Pass an optional port as a second argument to change that. Open http://localhost:6549/ and enjoy gifs!

A single image is focused at the top of the screen. Left/right/up/down arrows
change which gif is focused, or you can click a thumbnail.

You can search tags in the text bar at the top of the screen. The special tag
"untagged" finds images without any tags. Searching for nothing returns a
random assortment of gifs from your collection.

To edit the tags for the focused image, click the text bar below the focused
image.

If you tab out of the tag editing bar, it'll automatically focus the next
image, and drop your input into the tag editor. Helpful for bulk tag entry.
